How to add a file to your GitHub repository.    This file contains both my notes and the GitHub notes merged together.


    git add "name of the file you want to add"
    git commit -m "name of the file you want to add also"
    git push origin main

and that does it

and if you want to remove a file 
    
    git rm --cached "file-you-want-to-remove"

does it.

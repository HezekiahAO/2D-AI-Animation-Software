How to add a file to your GitHub repository.

    git add "name of the file you want to add"
    git commit -m "name of the file you want to add also"
    git push origin main

and that does it

and if you want to remove a file 
    
    git rm --cached "file-you-want-to-remove"

does it.

YOU CAN USE GIT BRANCH TO check where your codes are been commited to 

To check the repo you are currently working on, you do this with

git remote -v


I can always check for the name of my file using(usually, this is file may not be recognised by git with the same name you think)

git ls-file
